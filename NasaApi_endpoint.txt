nasa api key our API key for birch5trice@gmail.com is:

FbObavevTOIe6wbAREYidNxm2bBSzIBkvxwDiEXx


You will be recording the steps as you go, but the first set of tasks is for the nasa api (https://api.nasa.gov/):
1 get the api key
2 figure out what the base url and endpoint is for an image search
3 be able to describe the response for that endpoint


https://images-api.nasa.gov
API endpoint
Endpoint	
 /search?q={q}	
/asset/{nasa_id}	
 /metadata/{nasa_id}	
/captions/{nasa_id}
/album/{album_name}


search url
GET /search?q={q}
https://images-api.nasa.gov/search
?q=apollo%2011

Retrieving a media asset’s manifest
GET /asset/{nasa_id}
"https://images-api.nasa.gov/asset/as11-40-5874"


Retrieving a media asset’s metadata location
GET /metadata/{nasa_id}
"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/as11-40-5874/metadata.json"



Retrieving a video asset’s captions location
GET /captions/{nasa_id}
"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/video/172_ISS-Slosh/172_ISS-Slosh.sr



Retrieving a media album’s contents
GET /album/album_name
https://images-api.nasa.gov/album/apollo"


The next step is to create a React application using vite, and use react-router-dom to have the following three routes:
/ goes to Home
/nasalist goes to the NASA search page
/about goes to About
You only want the boiler plate and an <h1> with the title of the page you're on

The next step is to add the seach bar (you can use react movies) but just console.log the search term when the user hits submit(search)

Im missing  images, my challenges at times is the starting point.
